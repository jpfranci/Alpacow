# Alpacow üêÆ

Alpacow is a location-based social news web app that allows users to view, create, and interact with posts. The app aims to provide a communal online forum experience with up-to-date content relevant to our users' current location.

## Project Description

People are feeling more isolated than ever, since they must stay at least 2 meters away from each other. Our app will allow users in the same geographical location who want to stay updated on news/vibes of others. When the user opens the app, their location will be used to load the posts that are most relevant to them. The posts they view will be from other users in the same location and the posts they create will be accessible to those users as well. It will also be possible to interact with posts through upvotes and downvotes. To build on this project, some of our stretch goals are loading posts in real time without refreshing, adding user reputation, and allowing users to gift currency on posts they love.
