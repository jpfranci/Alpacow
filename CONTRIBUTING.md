# Starting Guide
Run `yarn bootstrap` to install dependencies on all packages (client and server)

Run `yarn dev` to run hot reload mode on all packages (client and server)

# Commits
Currently, we are running `prettier` on every commit to make sure everything is styled nicely.
This runs automatically and commits only staged files.
